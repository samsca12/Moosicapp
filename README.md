# Moosicapp

This app is pretty much simple. 
Based on your current "mood", select one of the six option displayed on the main view of the app. 
When you have selected your option, the app connects to Apple Music using MusicKit, and it delivers a random song based on your selected mood.
If you have chosen "Happy", for example, the app generates songs based on happy moood.
You can Like the song or share it by tapping their dedicated button. 
If you share the song a link is generated to direct you to apple music to listen to the song or just send it to your friends. 
At any time you can visit all your favourites song by cliking the heart icon at the top right of your screen.

The app provides VoiceOver accessibility and of course it connects to your Apple Music using Music Kit proving you a different way to listen to random and hopefully songs that you never knew.
