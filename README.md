# Moosicapp

This app provides an intuitive and mood-based music experience. From the main view, you can select one of six mood options. Once you've made your selection, the app uses MusicKit to connect to Apple Music, delivering a randomly chosen song that matches your mood.

For example, if you select "Happy," the app suggests a song that embodies joy and positivity. You can engage with the music by liking a song or sharing it through the dedicated buttons. Sharing generates a link that directs users to Apple Music, making it simple to enjoy or share the song with friends.

Your favorite songs are always accessible by tapping the heart icon in the top-right corner of the screen, providing quick access to your personalized collection.

With VoiceOver support, the app ensures an inclusive experience. This application offers a refreshing way to discover mood-based music, helping you explore new tracks in a personalized and engaging manner.
